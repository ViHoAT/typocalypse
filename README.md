This was a project for the first semester in the FH St.PÃ¶lten called the "Creative Code Labs 1: Playful Frontends" or CCL1 for short.

I created a auto-running platform game where platforms keep appearing as long as you survive.

The Special mechanic of the game was that each platform had a word on it that you have to type out and then press either "Enter" to teleport to the front or "Space" to jump on to the platform, these platforms also only manifest after you either jump or teleport.

This project was also fully self drawn in a sketch book style with little animations for the character.
