Day 2: 
Player can now jump and teleport on specific button press while still typing on an input.

Figuring out platform width and generation so that the character doesnâ€™t just have impossible jumps. Also making it so you can look at the platform and see which characters are right/wrong.

Camera, player and platform now increase in speed simultaneously and a score that also depends on your speed and how long you survive got added. Also starting to draw background.

Day 6: Drew the character and added a simple running animation to it.

Day 7: Drew an idle animation for the character and a background for the starting/end screen.

Day 8: Fixed some starting bugs and animation bugs and tried different features for the game. Aswell as trying to improve the drawings a bit more.
